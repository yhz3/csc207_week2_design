## Project Domain and High-Level Description

The project domain we decided on was data analysis, and in particular we want to 
create a Spotify data visualizer that shows trends in your music listening, such
as a chart with top artists on the x axis and minutes listened on the y axis, 
a visualizer for different genres of music you listen to, and potentially the 
ability to compare analytics with another friend.
