## Project Domain and High-Level Description

The project domain we decided on was data analysis. In particular, we want to 
find a way to analyze data from the Air Visual API by taking data in and using data
visualization libraries in Java to represent it.

## Current Technical Issues

One techincal issue was with pulling data from a local station, for some reason the 
api call according to the documentation is saying it is a bad request. Also, we need 
to figure out how to parse a JSON file instead of just printing it in the console as 
a string.
